        <h1>All About Me</h1>
        <p><b>My name is Anna Kelly.</b> I am sixteen years old and I go to Padua Academy Highschool. I was born at the Christiana Center Hospital on June 28th, 2002 to my parents Karen and Paul Kelly. We were in the United States at the time for my dad's job, and in 2004, we moved back to Manchester, England. My younger sister Charlotte was born a year later, in 2005. We stayed in England surrounded by family for seven more years, until June of 2012 came around, when we packed up our bags for a third time to move back to Delaware. I started fifth grade at Saint Mary Magdalen School and stayed there until I graduated and went to Padua.</p>
        <p>While there have been many changes throughout my life, one thing has stayed the same, my love for swimming. I began swimming when I was two years old, and I have not stopped since. I swam throughout my time in England, and continued after I moved to the United States. I first swam in America for the JCC, then transferred to the Brandywine YMCA swim team in sixth grade, then to the Rocky Run YMCA swim team in ninth grade. I swim for the summer league team, Silverside, and have done since fifth grade. I also made the Padua Swim team in ninth grade and continue to swim on there. </p>
        <p>I also have a dog. He is a cockapoo called Ollie. Ollie just turned two years old on December 27th, 2018. Although I am allergic to dogs, I still love my dog so much and I would suffer through the sneezing for him. He is the cutest dog in the whole world.</p>
